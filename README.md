# HouseOfCreativity
Mobile app for Android written in Kotlin for House of Youth Creativity of my diploma.

The stack I was used:

1. Room Database; 
2. Koltin Coroutines; 
3. LiveData; 
4. Android Chart for the cluster analysis; 
. ViewModel &amp; MVVM architecture; 
6. Dagger2; 
7. Unit-testing with JUnit.  

Not all functionality implemented, such as adding children and specialists to the groups, fix this later.
